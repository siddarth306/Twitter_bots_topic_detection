Agenda
- Package requirements
	- Look at requirements.txt
- Problem Statement
- Dataset format, my format
- Tool Supported Apps (report and coronavirus) and basic architecture
- How to run them? See README.md
- Reports
	- Data preprocessing
		- Clean tweet
		- Calculate Rake phrases from clean tweet
		- remove tweets without phrases
		- Calculate hashtags detected using NP+NE list
		- Calculate Share count (quotes_count + reply_count + retweet_count)
		
	- Topic detection preprocessing
		- Phrase Freq 
		- Phrase to Hashtags map
		- Phrase to share count map
		- Phrase to like count map
		- Phrase to tids list map
		- Hashtag Freq
		- Hashtag to Phrases map
		- Hashtag to share count map
		- Hashtag to like count map
		- Hashtag to tids list map
		- Phrase list with tfihf > 1
		- Hashtags list with hashtags freq > 7 for english and > 3 for non english
		
	- Topic Detection
		- Set epsilon and minpoints values.
			if hashtag count < 100 episilon = 0.2, minpoints = 1
			if >= 100 hashtag count < 500 episilon = 0.5, minpoints = 1
			else epsilon  = 0.5 min points = 2
		- Run DBSCAN algo and calculate only core points with epsilon and min Points
		- Run BFS on core points to get clusters
	- Creating Top links, tweets and CSVs for report
		- Ampilfy phrases using hashtags for each clusters
		- Find Associated tids for each clusters
		- Calculate stats like cluster share count, like count, bot count and tweet count
		- Calculate Top Links and Top Tweets using Min Hash algo.
		
	- Topic Linking (Nitesh)
	- Converting CSVs to JSONs for generating reports 
		- Convert CSVs after topic linking is done into JSON so that HTML reports can be generated.
	- Cons
		- Expanding phrases from hashtags. We consider all phrases.
		- Min hash algorithm for getting top tweets and top links.
		- For non english, if the number of tweets are very less detecting topics require to have lower epsilon and min points.
		- While running topic linking, it needs to run for all prior weeks. So computation time for topic linking will keep increasing.
		- A better alternative to rake that supports english and all non english languages of our tweets.
		- Week 13 onwards, the number of tweets to process for generating reports are exponentially higher. Before than a 16GB machine would suffice. Now larger servers would be needed.
		- Look into pandarallel package that helps perform pandas dataframe tasks parallely at the cost of extra memory.
